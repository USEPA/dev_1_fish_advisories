# Resources for Fish Advisories Mobile App (Team 1)

#### Generated during USEPA Developers Guild Team App Building Workshop, Oct 2016

## Why
Anglers need fast, mobile-enabled access to consumption advisory info

## What
A simple smartphone app that allows user to view advisories relative to her/his location or by searching by body of water

### Development Process
* Pre-development scoping
  * Initiated trello business canvas model -> created customer personas -> customer journey map
  * Iterated these concepts through subsequent stages
* Fast wireframe basic functionality
  *  draw.io -> trello sketchboard
* Initiate prototype
  * html + jQuery
* Refine wireframe

* Refine prototype

### Major Next steps
- Define backend functionality: advisory producers (e.g., state departments of health) vary in data management/access
