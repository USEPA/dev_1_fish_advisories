Fish Advisories Mobile App (Team 1)

#### Generated during USEPA Developers Guild Team App Building Workshop, Oct 2016

## Why
Anglers need fast, mobile-enabled access to consumption advisory info

## What
A simple smartphone app that allows user to view advisories relative to her/his location or by searching by body of water

### Development Process
* Pre-development scoping
  * Initiated trello business canvas model -> created customer personas -> customer journey map
  * Iterated these concepts through subsequent stages
* Fast wireframe basic functionality
  *  draw.io -> trello sketchboard
* Initiate prototype
  * html + jQuery
* Refine wireframe

* Refine prototype (demo clone and launch)

### Major Next steps
- Define backend functionality: advisory producers (e.g., state departments of health) vary in data management/access
  - [WA](http://www.doh.wa.gov/CommunityandEnvironment/Food/Fish/Advisories#PugetSound)
  - [OR](https://public.health.oregon.gov/HealthyEnvironments/Recreation/FishConsumption/Pages/fishadvisories.aspx)
- Requires partnering with state agencies
- Translations: effort to make visually/functionally simple and clean, but identify key stakeholder groups to define target languages
- Outreach and beta testing...

### Lessons learned
- From product owner/originator perspective, the engagement with technical demands clarified aspects of the problem, specifically the available data
- In-person meeting at project outset very valuable (Found a reasonable remote workflow, but geographic dispersion still a challenge)
- Aim for a single suite? (application overload: adobe connect, skype business, trello, draw.io, github)
  - could github work to centralize? using issues/wikis etc functionality (non-developers not have to worry about file mgmt)
